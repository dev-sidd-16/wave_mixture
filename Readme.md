----------------------------------------------------------------------

Execution:
---------

To launch the mixture type "./main.py" on command prompt and press ENTER. The GUI will be launched which will guide you through various functions.

Features:
---------
* Amplitude Scaling : Given a wave­form you have to scale with certain amount.

* Time Shift : Given a wave­form shift it along time axis.

* Time Scaling : Given a wave­form scale it along time axis.

* Time reversal : Reverse the wave along time axis.

* Mixing : To set certain values for each wave selected and then mix them to get another wave as output.

* Modulation : To set certain values for each wave selected and then modulate them to get another wave as output.

* Recording : To record a wave file and play it. 


Opening wav files:
------------------

* Click on "Select File" button, a dialogue box appears from which we can select the file.

Miscellanious Points:
---------------------

* The selected filename is displayed on the side of the button. It is blank if no file is selected, thus indicating to select a file, before anything can be played.

*[IMPORTANT] The mixing and modulation features are available only when there is no, or same time shifting and scalind done on the component wave files.
